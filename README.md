# React Chrome Extension Boilerplate

Boilerplate for a Chrome extension that uses React for the popup and options
views. Babel and webpack are all setup, and you can even use ES6 modules and
modern syntax for the `background.js` file, because it goes through the same
bundling and transpilation.

Basically, a modern revamp of
[this project,](https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate/tree/react)
which now appears to be dead.
